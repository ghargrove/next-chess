## Chess <> React

Wanted to play around with React a bit. So I built a chess game ♟️.

To get started, download the depenedencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and start playing chess!


### Other features to consider

- Tracking move history
- Having a simple AI player
- Allowing users to choose sides
- Allowing users to theme the board
- Starting the game from a library of setups (blitzkrieg, etc)
- Implement more complex moves (castling, etc)

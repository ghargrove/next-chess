## Chess <> React

![Chess board](/game-image.png)

This project started from a tech assessment where I was tasked with creating a checker board.

I though it would be fun to take that foundation and build a fully featured chess game.

It turned into a little hack-a-thon project I did over an evening.

### Running the app

To get started, download the depenedencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and start playing chess!


### Other features to consider

- Tracking move history
- Having a simple AI player
- Allowing users to choose sides
- Allowing users to theme the board
- Starting the game from a library of setups (blitzkrieg, etc)
- Implement more complex moves (castling, etc)

### Other code todo:

- write more robust path generation tests (more than just the pawn)
